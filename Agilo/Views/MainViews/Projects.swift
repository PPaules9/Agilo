Project View: In this tab, users can access a list of projects theyâ€™ve created or are participating in. They can view details about each project, including its backlog, sprint history, and team members. This view allows for comprehensive project management and tracking.
 
 **Project View**:
    - **Project List**: Present a list of projects created by the user or shared with them, along with key project details such as project name, team members, and current status (e.g., active, completed).
    - **Project Details**: Upon selecting a specific project, display comprehensive project details including the backlog of user stories, sprint history, release plans, and any associated documents or files.
    - **Team Collaboration**: Enable users to manage team collaboration by viewing team member roles, assigning tasks, and communicating within the project via comments or chat functionality.
    - **Progress Tracking**: Provide visual representations of project progress, such as sprint burndown charts, velocity charts, and cumulative flow diagrams, to help users monitor project health and identify potential bottlenecks.
