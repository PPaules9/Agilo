    - **Real-time Collaboration**: Support real-time collaboration among team members during spike sessions, allowing participants to share updates, discuss solutions, and make decisions collaboratively.
    - **Escalation Alerts**: Implement notification mechanisms to alert relevant stakeholders about spike sessions or urgent issues, ensuring timely response and resolution of critical project concerns.
